        "\n",
        "   - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of \"objects,\" which encapsulate data and behavior within a single entity. It emphasizes principles like **encapsulation** (hiding internal details and exposing only necessary parts), **inheritance** (reusing and extending existing code), **polymorphism** (using a single interface for different data types), and **abstraction** (simplifying complex systems by modeling real-world entities). OOP promotes modularity, reusability, and scalability, making it ideal for building complex and maintainable software systems. Languages like Java, Python, C++, and C# are widely used for OOP."

A class acts as a structure that encapsulates data and functionality, promoting code reusability and organization. For example, in Python, a `Car` class might have attributes like `color` and `model` and methods like `drive()` and `brake()`, allowing multiple `Car` objects to be created with different attributes but the same behavior."

For example, if `Car` is a class, then `myCar = Car(\"red\", \"Tesla\")` is an object with attributes like `\"red\"` for color and `\"Tesla\"` for the model.

In short, abstraction defines **what** details to hide, while encapsulation controls **how** data is accessed and maintained."

These methods allow objects to integrate with Python's built-in functions and behaviors. For example, `__init__` initializes an object, `__str__` defines how an object is represented as a string, and `__add__` allows custom behavior for the `+` operator.

For example, if `Animal` is a parent class with a `make_sound()` method, a `Dog` class can inherit from it and override `make_sound()` to return `\"Bark\"`.

Encapsulation is implemented using **getter and setter methods** to control access and modification of private attributes. For example, in a `BankAccount` class, `__balance` is a private variable, and its access is controlled through methods like `get_balance()` and `deposit()`. This prevents unintended data modification while maintaining security and integrity in object-oriented programming."

A **class method** (defined using `@classmethod`) takes `cls` as its first parameter and operates on class-level attributes, allowing modifications that affect all instances. For example, `Car.set_wheels(6)` can change the `wheels` attribute for all `Car` objects. A **static method** (defined using `@staticmethod`) does not take `self` or `cls` and is used for utility functions that do not modify class or instance attributes, like a `MathUtils.add(x, y)` method for addition.
